#Front-end Job Interview Questions

This file contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

**Note:** Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

#### Network Questions:

* Traditionally, why has it been better to serve site assets from multiple domains?

The biggest reason is for performance. Traditionally, a browser has only been able to serve two concurrent requests to a single domain at the same time. However, you can send concurrent requests to various domains at the same time. This is not as much of an issue now as it used to be, since most modern browsers can serve at least 6 concurrent requests to a single domain, but the principle remains the same. 

A secondary benefit would be not being overly reliant on a single source. If all of your assets come from the exact same domain, then if that domain is down, or being slow, then every single resource on your page will be laggy or fail. 



* Do your best to describe the process from the time you type in a website's URL to it finishing loading on your screen.

Even before you hit 'Enter' on your keyboard, there is a lot of code being run behind the scene. First the browser is looking to make your life easier by pre-populating the url input for you, based on bookmarks, history, and favorites. 

As soon as you hit enter, whatever you had in the url bar is parsed- there is a protocol (http or https), and there is a domain. If there is not a valid domain (for example https://github.com) provided, then it will treat whatever you typed as web search term, and redirect the user to google search results. If a protocol is not provided, but the domain is legit (www.github.com or github.com), then the browser will check an HSTS list (HTTP Strict Transport Security), which is essentially a list of websites that have opted to only be communicated with via HTTPS. Otherwise the browser will assume HTTP. 

The next step is DNS lookup. A domain is actually in number and decimal format, such as 192.30.253.116 for example. First the browser checks the cache, and then checks a local "hosts" file whose location on the computer varies by computer and operating system. Only if the domain cannot be "resolved" in this way, will the browser make a request to a DNS server. This lookup should be very fast, as DNS servers essentially have one purpose, and are optimized for this quick retrieval (similar in format to a hashing function). 





* What are the differences between Long-Polling, Websockets and Server-Sent Events?
* Explain the following request and response headers:
  * Diff. between Expires, Date, Age and If-Modified-...
  * Do Not Track
  * Cache-Control
  * Transfer-Encoding
  * ETag
  * X-Frame-Options
* What are HTTP methods? List all HTTP methods that you know, and explain them.

#### Coding Questions:

*Question: What is the value of `foo`?*
```javascript
var foo = 10 + '20';
```
'1020'

An integer plus a string always results in a string. Even 10 + 'twenty' === '10twenty'

*Question: How would you make this work?*
```javascript
add(2, 5); // 7
add(2)(5); // 7
```

*Question: What value is returned from the following statement?*
```javascript
"i'm a lasagna hog".split("").reverse().join("");
```
"goh angasal a m'i"


*Question: What is the value of `window.foo`?*
```javascript
( window.foo || ( window.foo = "bar" ) );
```
The value of window.foo will be "bar". We are running an "or" expression above. Since the first part, window.foo is undefined for now, it is falsey, and therefore will attempt to run the other half, in this case window.foo = 'bar', and since variable assignment is truthy, this portion will execute and successfully define the foo variable on the window object as "bar".

*Question: What is the outcome of the two alerts below?*
```javascript
var foo = "Hello";
(function() {
  var bar = " World";
  alert(foo + bar);
})();
alert(foo + bar);
```
First there will be a "Hello World" alert, since the immediately invoked function has variable bar defined inside of it, and also has access to its global scope, where foo was defined. Then the browser will attempt to give you a 2nd alert but will give you a reference error since bar is not defined (var bar = ' World' is private to the immediately invoked function). 

*Question: What is the value of `foo.length`?*
```javascript
var foo = [];
foo.push(1);
foo.push(2);
```
2

*Question: What is the value of `foo.x`?*
```javascript
var foo = {n: 1};
var bar = foo;
foo.x = foo = {n: 2};
```
foo.x is undefined. The code on the last line moves from right to left, so first foo is reassigned to object {n: 2}, then foo.x is assigned foo. Yet it comes out as undefined. Interestingly, if we replace foo with another variable, such as bar:
foo.x = bar = {n: 2}
then foo === {n: 1, x: {n: 2}} which is more consistent with what we would expect it to be. 


*Question: What does the following code print?*
```javascript
console.log('one');
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('two');
}, 0);
console.log('three');
```
It prints
'one'
'three'
'two'

I was under the impression that occasionally it may print "one" "two" "three", since the setTimeout function has a 0 second interval, and because wrapping the console.log('two') in the setTimeout is not a time intensive operation, but indeed it seems to consistently console.log in the order above.
